        <h2>Brock</h2>
        <p>
          A self-proclaimed data nerd with a distaste for baseless arguments and
          emotional decisions, Brock has always been about bringing facts to the
          gridiron. When he isn't serving up solutions at Sudokrew, a software
          shop in Hawaii, he's neck deep in deep learning and developing ways in
          which he can predict seemingly randoms events, such as sporting events
          and stock prices. If forced to name one thing he loves as much as
          football, itâ€™d be Persian cats.{' '}
        </p>
        <h2>Sal</h2>
        <p>
          As a lifelong Cleveland Browns fan and aspiring college professor, Sal

          decade in five different leagues while simultaneously holding a job
          and completing multiple college degrees, Better Odds of Football is
          the latest of his analytic sporting endeavors. He hopes to spread his
          knowledge of sports, sports statistics, and sports phenomena across
          the internet like avocado toast, and enjoys football so much he is
          currently writing a thesis paper on the topic. Sal also loves a good
          map.
